![Recipe Image](../../public/assets/corn_tortillas.jpg)

## Ingredients

| Ingredient | Quantity |
|------------|----------|
| Maseca Corn Masa | 2 cups |
| Water | 2 cups |

## Instructions

1. Mix the masa with water (a little at a time) and work so that it evenly distributed through the flour. The dough is supposed to feel wet when you squeeze but not stick to your hand
1. Divide the dough into 15 equal parts and roll into smooth balls about 1.5 inches in diameter. Place under plastic wrap so they dont dry out
2. Heat an ungreased comal or griddle overa medium flame to warm completely
3. Open up the tortilla press and place a small bag on the bottom plate. Place a ball of the dough on bottom bag, a little off center toward the hinge, and press it out with your fingers to flatten a little. Cober with the second bag and press down firmly, but not too hard
4. Open the press, remove the top bag, ift the bottom bag in one hand, place the dough onto the fingers of your other hand, and very carefully peel the bag off the flattened dough
5. Lay the tortilla falt onto the cormal/griddle. there should be a slight sizzle as the dough touches the surface. Leave for about 15 seconds; the underside will have opaque patches and be slightly speckled with brown
6. Flip the tortilla over onto the second side and cook for a further 30 seconds; the underside should now be opaque and speckled
7. Pat the dough to get the dough to puff. Flip back onto the first side again and cook for 15 second more. Hold in foil to steam

## Ingredients

| Ingredient     | Quantity  |
|----------------|-----------|
| Spaghetti      | 200g      |
| Garlic         | 4 cloves  |
| Olive Oil      | 3 tbsp    |
| Red Pepper Flakes | 1 tsp  |
| Parsley        | 2 tbsp    |
| Salt           | To taste  |

## Instructions

1. **Cook the spaghetti**: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, then cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions.
2. **Prepare the garlic**: While the pasta cooks, thinly slice the garlic.
3. **Heat the oil**: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, cooking until the garlic is golden and fragrant.
4. **Combine**: Once the spaghetti is done, reserve some pasta water and drain the rest. Add the pasta to the skillet, tossing to coat with the garlic oil mixture. Add some reserved pasta water if needed to create a silky sauce.
5. **Garnish**: Remove from heat, stir in fresh parsley, and serve with a sprinkle of salt to taste.

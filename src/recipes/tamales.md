6. The dough should be soft and fluffy like cake batter
7. Drain husks and set aside 20 largest leaves.  Place husks, concabe side up on a clean surface, wide end nearest you.
8. Spread 1/4 cup masa across bottom third husk , leaving 1/2" border at wide end.  Spread a scant tablespoon of chili sauce over masa, and spread 1 1/2 tablespoon meat on top.
9. Gather long sides of husk together and pinch along seam to ensure that masa encases filling.  Fold husk in half crosswise.
10. Repeat process to make 20 tamales in all.  Place tamales upright, leaning them against one another in top of a steamer.
11. Place steamer over a pot of simmering water over medium heat, cover with a clean dish towel, and cover with a lid.
